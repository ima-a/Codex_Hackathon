QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
======================================================================


The PPO-trained agents demonstrate learned behavior that balances:
  - Customer service (meeting demand)
  - Inventory costs (holding costs)
  - Stockout penalties (lost sales)

This is achieved through:
  - Reconciliation-driven rewards from business metrics
  - Hierarchical multi-agent coordination (Stores → Warehouse → Supplier)
  - Shared PPO policy across store agents (CTDE)
  - Experience pooling for efficient learning
